What it's all about: Enhanced Survival. Mostly a complete conversion of the game in ways but still honoring the vanilla concept. Basically you try to survive with a team in an unforgiving world where bosses have been added and the monster AI has been boosted. They dig to you, they build to you and they make you suffer. But in return you are given technology which once you build the buildings unlock soldiers to use, miners to mine, and catapults to unleash upon other teams trying to survive in the world.
