# This is the localization file for the Magic plugin.
#
# All in-game text can be controlled from this file.
#
# The default will always be loaded first, so the English messages will be used for any
# keys you do not provide in this file.
#
# See the defaults file (defaults/messages.defaults.yml) for all available localization keys.
