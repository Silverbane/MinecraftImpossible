# !! IMPORTANT !!
#
# Do not edit this file. It is overwritten by Magic on reload.
#
# If you wish to customize this plugin, copy the "*.defaults.yml" file to "*.yml" and edit the new one.
#
# For instance, copy "magic.defaults.yml" to "magic.yml", and then edit magic.yml.
#
# ALSO IMPORTANT
#
# Note that once you have customized your configuration, it will be more difficult to get updates.
# I will provide migration instructions in the changelog, and make an effort (post-release) to ensure
# that updates won't break existing configurations.
#
# However, if you don't pay attention to the changelog notes on update, you may miss out on new spells, features
# or wands. This can usually be resolved easily using the github diffs (which I will try to link to when appropriate)
# adding in whatever is missing to your customized configuration.
#
# LOCALIZATION
#
# Note that ALL in-game text is contained in this file. 
#
# If you are only customizing to localize text, you can leave the rest of the configuration files alone.
# Additionally, I would love to collect your localized file, if you'd be so kind as to provide it!
