# Modify this file to change the overall behavior of the Magic plugin.
# only include the options you want to modify.
#
# To see all available options, look in the defaults/config.defaults.yml file.
#
# Options for sub-components (spells, wand templates, chest populator, etc) are 
# found in separate files.
#

#
# This is the general configuration file for the magic plugin.
# 
# Wand and Spell configurations are separate, in wands.yml and spells.yml.
# Localizations are also separate, in messages.yml. 
#

# For example, to make it so all construction spells automatically undo their effects
# after ten seconds:
#
# general:
#   auto-undo: 10000
