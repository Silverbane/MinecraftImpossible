###----------------------- Config ------------------------###
###   Here are the configurable options for the plugin    ###

### DESCRIPTION ###
# The animal plague is designed to do two things.
#    1) Make the game harder by making it possible to lose herds
#       of animals.
#    2) Keep lag down by killing animals when there are too many.
#
# Depending on the settings below, you can create an unstoppable
# plague that wipes out all animals in its path, or a small 
# control plague that will only kill newly spawned animals when
# a herd gets too large. It is highly recommended that you
# configure your plague before setting it loose on the world.
# They currently configured plague is very contagious and will
# appear after only 20 animals are found inside a 20 x 20 x 20
# cube.

# This list is all animals that can catch the plague. All animals
# are effected equally. When ever I refer to "animals" I am
# refering to this list.
PlagueAnimals:
  - SHEEP
  - COW
  - PIG
  - CHICKEN

# The plague works in stages.
#    1) Symptoms and weakness: During this stage the animal
#       becomes weaker and symptoms will start to appear.
#    2) Spreading: During this stage the infected animal will
#       start to infect others. 
#    3) Death: In this stage the animal is killed.


# leave this off unless the plugin is not working. 
# Use this to help report errors to me or fix them yourself.
Debug: false

### STAGE ZERO ###

# The amount of animals that need to be within a certain area for
# a plague to start.
AnimalAmount: 20 
# This radius is centered at the newly spawned Animal. 
Radius: 5 # This means a 10 x 10 x 10 cube

# Testing a 3 minecraft day plauge cycle 7200 Seconds on our server.
### STAGE ONE ###

# Use this setting to set the time between when an infected animal
# spawns and when its first visible symptoms appear. This time is
# measured in ticks.  20 ticks = 1 second
PlagueStartTime: 12000 # 12000 ticks = 10 minutes

### STAGE TWO ###

# The infection chance. The plague will try to infect a new animal
# every five seconds. This is the chance that an infection will
# occur. 0 means no chance and 10 means 100% chance.
InfectionChance: 0.1

### STAGE THREE ###

# The amount of time an animal will survive after having its
# first noticeable symptoms. An animals life span with the plague
# can be measured by adding the PlagueStartTime and
# the PlagueKillDelay.
#Measured in intervals of 5 seconds.
PlagueKillDelay: 1320 # so 9 * 5 = 45 seconds delay.
# 45 + 60(PlagueStartTime) = 1 min and 45 sec life span.


# Congrats! You can now go watch you plague at work.
