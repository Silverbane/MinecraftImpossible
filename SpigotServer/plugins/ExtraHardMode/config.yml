#                                                                                                  #
# 1. The config cleans itself, so if something resets you probably did something wrong             #
# 2. Generally if you can specify a block you can add meta after an @                              #
#    F.e: STEP@3 = cobblestone slab. STEP@3,11 matches normal&upside cobble slabs                  #
#    If you specify meta it will only match cobble slabs and not the other slabs.                  #
#    If you don't specify meta it matches all slabs.                                               #
#    You can use numerical block ids as well, they will be converted to bukkit names               #
# 3. If your empty lists reset, put [] instead                                                     #
# 4. This config changes regularly, so you might want to revisit it after an update.               #
# 5. Lots of the configuration is user requested so if you need something just ask                 #
# 6. Remember to use /ehm reload after you changed the config instead of /reload                   #
#                                                                                                  #
