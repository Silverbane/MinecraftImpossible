  #the item which is associated with the projectile.
  #items can be assigned to many different projectiles which are used with different cannons
  #example: one cannon can be loaded with stone but will fire an armor piercing round, while a different cannon
  #can be loaded with stone and it will fire an explosive projectile
  loadingItem: '264:0'
